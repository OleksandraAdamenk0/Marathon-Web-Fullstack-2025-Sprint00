    <h2 id="1section">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>
        A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them
        in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power
        that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power
        to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
        <br>
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story
        or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy,
        it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do,
        couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero
